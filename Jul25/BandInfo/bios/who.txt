    The Who are an English rock band formed in 1964 by singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and bassist John Entwistle. They were joined shortly after by drummer Keith Moon and became known for energetic live performances which often included instrument destruction. The Who have sold about 100 million records, and have charted 27 top forty singles in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as 17 top ten albums, with 18 Gold, 12 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone.

    The Who rose to fame in the UK with a series of top ten hit singles, boosted in part by pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline, beginning in January 1965 with "I Can't Explain". The albums My Generation (1965), A Quick One (1966) and The Who Sell Out (1967) followed, with the first two reaching the UK top five. They first hit the US Top 40 in 1967 with "Happy Jack" and hit the top ten later that year with "I Can See for Miles". Their fame grew with memorable performances at the Monterey Pop, Woodstock and Isle of Wight music festivals. The 1969 release of Tommy was their first major commercial success, reaching number 4 in the US charts. Various sources estimate the album has now sold over 20 million copies internationally. This was followed up by the successes of Who's Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), The Who by Numbers (1975), and Who Are You (1978). With the exception of The Who by Numbers, all of these reached the top 5 of the US charts, with by Numbers making the top 10. Also successful was the live album Live at Leeds (1970), and the soundtrack album The Kids Are Alright (1979), reaching number 4 and 8 on the US charts, respectively.

    Keith Moon died at the age of 32 on 7 September 1978, after which the band released two studio albums, the UK and US top five Face Dances (1981) and the US top ten It's Hard (1982), with drummer Kenney Jones from The Small Faces/The Faces, before disbanding in 1983. They re-formed at events such as Live Aid and for reunion tours such as their 25th anniversary tour (1989) and the Quadrophenia tours of 1996, 1997, 2012 and 2013. In 2000, the three surviving original members discussed recording an album of new material, but their plans were temporarily stalled by Entwistle's death at the age of 57 in 2002. Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who and in 2006 they released the studio album Endless Wire, which reached the top ten in the UK and US.
